When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
working on teams !

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
sometimes we are working within huge projects which have many things which are split into tasks for teams each team has no idea about other team work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork:clone between repo's online , clone : clone between repo's online / offline , branches: take other way far of master way to do some thing
will use fork with the other's works , clone with my own work either other's work but i cloned into my account or my real work
, will use branches to do any thing new such as a new experiments , fixing typos , adding new features or trying something strange.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
for attaching and update processes when we pull and merge ( fast forward )

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
nothing , copy and paste would be harder

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

directly in master sounds not good to introduce to the client with the whole shitts which happened while the project + what if i am working in some big
projects with multiple features .. multiple tracks.
directly in master : may be with the small project with myself
