When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
working on teams !
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
sometimes we are working within huge projects which have many things which are split into tasks for teams each team has no idea about other team work
